            <h4>Goals and Conclusions</h4><br>

            <h4>Goals</h4><br>
            
            The primary goal for this project was to acheve a basic understanding of the unity game engine's <br>
            tools and general layout. Within which I acheved a moderate grasp of spritesheet dividing, animation creating and pramater<br>
            crafting, asset/sprite movement and interation appratus setup, and a general understanding of the 2D side of <br>
            the Unity game engine and it's variety of addon-modules and tools.

            <br><br>

            In general I belive I met my goals in the form of my game, whereby which i've presented my developments <br>
            and achevements in my goal by presenting a fully functioning two-player game with animations and attacks simulated <br>
            within and enviroment which presents a clear playing field and parameters the gameobjects (players and projectiles) interact with. <br>
            although I belive that I could do better and incorperate more features, it is for time's sake that I <br>
            submit this basic version of my game, perhaps at a later date I will uptate versions on itchio or github.

            <br><br>

            I also belive that my product acheved a grat sense of independence from my tutorials as the entire <br>
            system of my game attributed no great adherence to the tutorials I utilised within the works cited page.
            
            <br>

            <h4>Tips</h4><br>

            A few tips I can provide for the unity assets bar is to always create an empty gameboject before incorperating all the assets <br>
            going into the gameobject as it serves as a pseudo-folder and makes it way easier for organisation and debugging.<br>
            You should also import sprites from outside unity when possible as creating in-house sprites not only hog the storage <br>
            and operation space, but also are a PAIN to edit and layer one by one.<br>
            You should also order the assets bar when nessicary, grouping enviroment asets under one empty gameobject<br>
            and player/enemy characters/gameobjects under a likewise gameobject.

            <br><br>

            Animations should always connect to an idle or defalut animation and the initial "parameter" connection<br>
            path should not have an exit time (but the exit/back to defalut path should, and it should be 1), the transition<br>
            time should be 0 for instantanious animation. Animations will not change the hitbox of your charachter<br>
            so don't make the comat system rely on animations to work. Instead you should just create ultiple points around the player <br>
            rig for the combat to take place or interact with the player. (combat points, points where player can damage others)
