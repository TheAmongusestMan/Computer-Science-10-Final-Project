            <h4>Careers Overview</h4><br>

            Although my abilities within Unity may seem at first to be a niche within a niche hobby or industry<br>
            , it has been apparent within the past few decades that those familiar with websites or application such as <br>
            any adobie app, CAD file/editor, and game development engines such as unity are in high demmand.<br>
            As of such, I have compiled a list of potential work paths for me and subequent practitioners of unity<br>
            within all applicable industries <br>
            <br>

            <div><ul>
                <li><h4>Junior Unity Designer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Senior Unity Designer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Junior Unity Developer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Game Developer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>AR/VR developer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>2D/3D Designer</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Project Instructor</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Unity Instructor</h4></li>
                <li><h4>Sound Designer</h4></li>
    
            </ul>
            <br>

            As the unity/digital goods market has recently increased by a margin of 7.4%, I belive that these careers<br>
            are in relatively high demand as apparent by their six figure salaries. These careers can also be done from <br>
            home, minimising stress within the workplace, the risk of losing your job, and increasing liberalising of hours<br>
            provided to employees. In addition, you could also create games of your own and support yourself upon the basis <br>
            of purchases or ad revenue, once more expanding your repretoire.
