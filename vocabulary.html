            My project was partialy due to the result of Mr Flower's Pyret programing course and the, <br>
            variety of arduino ide programs we programed within Robotics. I personaly can relate this project <br>
            as an extension of Pyret and my first Robotics project, being a gamestation.<br>
            Within this project i utilised elements of both, the organisation and checkers of pyret combined<br>
            with my understanding of variables and their cataluysts of change attributed to the arduino ide<br>
            ultimantely contributed to my sucsess within this project. Therefore I have to include them <br>
            as somewhat of a cite within this.
