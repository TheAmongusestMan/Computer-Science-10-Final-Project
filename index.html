            Currently in high school and working torwards succeeding within the IBDP diploma program offered by <br>
            my school, this website is to present a grade-10 Computer Science final project whereby I aim to <br>
            create a working two-player 2d combat game with animations, a life system, and working attacks.
            <br><br>
            Within this project I aim to understand the basics of the video game engine Unity, including <br>
            it's assets, tools, and the programing language associated with the development process of a game <br>
            created utilising it' engine. The final product will be a two-player duel or battle-esqe game, with<br>
            two characters, a health and attack system, as well as uniqe enviroment sprites alongside <br>
            movement and attack animations.
            <br><br>
            The results I present as my final product is the third/culmination of three program's worth of projects<br>
            as the first two I utilised more as testbeds or sandboxes to learn the basics of the engine and more or less <br>
            as a sheet of "Scrap paper" to make mistakes upon as the tools within the Unity engine are complex and <br> 
            often overlap with eachother. My final thoughts upon the Unity engine is one of anticipation as despite the<br>
            complexity in code and format of my simple game, I belive it still to be lacking in features and functions which <br>
            perhaps I could include in a later date.
